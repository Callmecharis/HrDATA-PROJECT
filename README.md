# HrDATA-PROJECT
This is where i documented my data when studying data analysis  using Power BI in Skill Harvest Academy
## Overview/Introduction
The Human Resource data showcases the attrition in a given company.
Attrition is the turnover or employee churn, refers to the natural process of employees leaving a company, either voluntarily or involuntarily. It is a common phenomenon that affects organizations across various industries, resulting in the departure of experienced and skilled employees. Attrition can have significant implications on a company's productivity, morale, and bottom line.
In the process of this analysis exploratory data analysis method will be used, this data analysis method uses visual displays and statistical tools to explore data sets for patterns, relationships, and anomalies. The goal of EDA is to learn about the data, rather than to confirm a hypothesis. 
EDA is an iterative process that involves:Visualizing data,identifying patterns and anomalies, generating hypotheses,data collection and cleaning.
In the process of analysis, i was able to deduce the count of attrition, rate of attrition in the company
