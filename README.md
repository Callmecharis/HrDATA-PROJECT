# HR DATA-PROJECT
This is where I documented my data when studying data analysis  using Power BI in Skill Harvest Academy
## Overview/Introduction
The Human Resource data showcases the attrition in a given company.
Attrition is the turnover or employee churn, refers to the natural process of employees leaving a company, either voluntarily or involuntarily. It is a common phenomenon that affects organizations across various industries, resulting in the departure of experienced and skilled employees. Attrition can have significant implications on a company's productivity, morale, and bottom line.
In the process of this analysis exploratory data analysis method will be used, this data analysis method uses visual displays and statistical tools to explore data sets for patterns, relationships, and anomalies. The goal of EDA is to learn about the data, rather than to confirm a hypothesis using all these parameters to gain insight to make informed business decision with data gotten from the summarisation of data and data visualization.
EDA is an iterative process that involves:Visualizing data,identifying patterns and anomalies, generating hypotheses,data collection and cleaning.
In the process of analysis, i was able to deduce the count of attrition, rate of attrition in the company
## TOOLS USED
*	Ms Excel Download Here (http//www.excel.com)
* Power BI Download Here (http//www.PowerBi.com)

 ## DATA CLEANING AND PREPARATION
In the process of data cleaning and preparation i performed the following actions
1. data loading
2. Removal of unnecessary column
3. Data cleaning and formating
4. creating addition measure by adding conditional column on the data model
5.Data cleaning and transformation are critical steps in preparing raw data for analysis.
In Power BI, we used Power Query to apply various transformations, ensuring that the data was consistent, accurate, and ready for analysis.
Key transformations: when the data is transformed on Power Bi we checked on the View tab for Column quality, value distribution,, column profile, column distribution, column statistics
## DATA USED
The primary source of the data is gotten from ms excel and this an open source data that can easily be downloaded from an open source online```
## DATA ANALYSIS
In the cause of the analysis, 
In summary, data analysis of open-source information is a powerful tool that can facilitate knowledge, promote transparency, and encourage shared progress. By engaging with these datasets.
In analysing the data we able to deduce the cause of attrition, rate of attrition several measure as well as Dax function are used to generate the rate of attrition in the company , the department with the highest attrition rate, attriton by age-band, attrition by gender.```
## EXPLORATORY DATA (EDA)
 a data analysis method that uses visual displays and statistical tools to explore data sets for patterns, relationships, and anomalies. The goal of EDA is to learn about the data, rather than to confirm a hypothesis. 
EDA is an iterative process that involves:
Data collection and cleaning
Visualizing data
Identifying patterns and anomalies
Generating hypotheses
EDA involved the exploring of the data  with visualisation on Power BI to answer some questions about the data such as;

i. Sum of attrition count
ii. Sum of attrition by Education Field
iii. Sum of employee number
iv. Average age of attrition
v. Sum of monthly income
vi. Count of attrition overtime
vii. count of attrition by job role
viii. Attrition by Age band
ix. count of attrition by Gender
x. count of attrition by marital status
xi.Maximum of monthly income 
xii. count of attrition by education```
## INSIGHT/INFERENCE
The key insight derived from analysing the HR Data using Power Bi as tool of analysis to generate visuals that depicts the rate of attrition, the count of attrition, the department with the highest attrition, the average age of attrition. These enables us to understand the reason for attrition, sum of attrition, the age band with the highest attrition and its implication of the company's productivity.```
## CONCLUSION
In conclusion, by the dept of the analysis carried out  attrition rate in the company is deduce, count of attrition by gender, profession, department, education field, age band,current employee and so on. with all these factors considered the company can strategise to reduce attrition  by monitoring and addressing early warning or signs of attrition, communicate oepnly and transparently with employees, recognise and reward employee's contribution etc.
